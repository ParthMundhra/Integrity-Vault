## Key Threats and Mitigations

### 1. Evidence Tampering (Off‑Chain)

**Description**: An attacker or malicious insider modifies or replaces a stored evidence file in the off‑chain storage system (e.g., changes bytes in a disk image or log file).

**Impact**:
- Potential invalidation of investigative findings and legal cases.
- Loss of trust in the evidence management process.

**Mitigations**:
- **Cryptographic Hashing**:
  - Compute SHA‑256 hash of each evidence file at upload time.
  - Store hashes immutably on the Ethereum blockchain and in PostgreSQL.
- **Regular Integrity Checks**:
  - On demand and periodic verification workflows that:
    - Retrieve the encrypted file.
    - Decrypt it using the AES key.
    - Recompute the hash and compare against the blockchain record.
- **Tamper‑Evident Storage**:
  - Enforce write‑once semantics at the application layer: evidence files are append‑only or immutable.
  - Use storage systems that support object versioning and immutable retention policies.
- **Access Control and Logging**:
  - Strong RBAC: restrict who can upload or mark evidence as superseded.
  - Detailed audit logs for all access to evidence files, including reads and downloads.

---

### 2. Insider Modification of Custody Records

**Description**: A privileged user or administrator attempts to alter or delete historical custody events to conceal mishandling or tampering.

**Impact**:
- Undermines the integrity of the chain‑of‑custody.
- Weakens evidentiary value in legal proceedings.

**Mitigations**:
- **Immutable Blockchain Storage**:
  - All custody events are appended to a smart contract log and cannot be edited or removed once confirmed on the blockchain.
- **Write‑Only API for Custody Events**:
  - The backend only supports appending new events, never updating or deleting existing ones.
- **Role‑Based Permissions**:
  - Only authorized roles can initiate custody actions; their identifiers (or pseudonymous IDs) are recorded on‑chain.
- **Database Consistency Checks**:
  - Periodic reconciliation:
    - Compare custody events in PostgreSQL with those on the blockchain.
    - Detect and flag discrepancies for investigation.

---

### 3. Forged Custody Events

**Description**: An attacker attempts to create fake custody events suggesting that an unauthorized user handled evidence, or that evidence followed a different path than it actually did.

**Impact**:
- Misleading or fabricated history of evidence handling.
- Potential to discredit legitimate evidence by injecting conflicting records.

**Mitigations**:
- **Strong Authentication & MFA**:
  - Enforce secure authentication for all users (password + MFA or hardware tokens).
- **Backend‑Mediated Contract Access**:
  - Users do not interact with the smart contract directly.
  - All blockchain writes are performed by the backend after enforcing authorization and validation rules.
- **Cryptographic Binding to Evidence IDs**:
  - Custody events reference canonical evidence IDs and hashes.
  - The contract validates that events are associated with existing evidence records.
- **Audit Trails and Alerts**:
  - Monitor for anomalous custody patterns (e.g., unexpected transfers or high‑volume activity).
  - Generate alerts and require secondary approvals for sensitive actions.

---

### 4. Unauthorized Access to Evidence Files

**Description**: An external attacker, insider, or compromised account gains access to raw evidence files or decrypted content without proper authorization.

**Impact**:
- Exposure of sensitive investigative data and PII.
- Legal and regulatory violations.

**Mitigations**:
- **AES Encryption at Rest**:
  - Encrypt all evidence files with strong AES (e.g., AES‑256‑GCM).
  - Store keys in a KMS or secure secrets manager with strict access controls.
- **Least‑Privilege Access to Decryption Keys**:
  - Only the backend service (and limited operational workflows) may obtain decryption keys.
  - Operators cannot directly access keys or unencrypted files.
- **Fine‑Grained Authorization**:
  - Role‑based and case‑based access control policies in the backend.
  - Restrict who can view or download evidence.
- **Network Segmentation**:
  - Isolate evidence storage and database from public networks.
  - Use private subnets, firewalls, and VPC‑level controls.

---

### 5. Unauthorized Access to Custody Metadata

**Description**: An attacker gains access to metadata that reveals sensitive information (who handled which evidence, when, and for which case), even if the evidence content remains encrypted.

**Impact**:
- Privacy and operational security concerns.
- Potential to infer investigative scope and relationships.

**Mitigations**:
- **Pseudonymization of User Identifiers On‑Chain**:
  - On‑chain records may store pseudonymous IDs or role identifiers instead of full personal details.
- **Access Control to Backend APIs**:
  - Only authorized users can resolve pseudonymous IDs to real identities.
- **Minimization of On‑Chain Metadata**:
  - Limit on‑chain data to what is necessary for integrity and traceability.
  - Keep detailed mappings in the backend database with stricter access control.

---

### 6. Compromise of Backend or Database

**Description**: An attacker compromises the FastAPI backend or PostgreSQL database (e.g., via vulnerability exploitation or stolen credentials).

**Impact**:
- Manipulation of metadata.
- Unauthorized access to encrypted evidence or decryption operations.
- Attempted creation of fraudulent custody events.

**Mitigations**:
- **Defense‑in‑Depth**:
  - Network isolation, hardened OS images, and minimized attack surface.
  - Regular patching, vulnerability scanning, and dependency management.
- **Separation of Duties**:
  - Distinct roles for system administration, security operations, and application maintenance.
- **Restricted DB Permissions**:
  - Application accounts only have the minimum required privileges.
  - Use read‑only replicas for reporting where appropriate.
- **Immutable Blockchain Layer**:
  - Even if the database is compromised, existing on‑chain custody records remain tamper‑evident.
  - Reconciliation processes can identify discrepancies introduced by a compromised backend.

---

### 7. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

**Description**: Bugs or design flaws in the smart contract allow unauthorized state changes, reordering of events, or denial‑of‑service.

**Impact**:
- Corrupted or inconsistent custody records.
- Inability to append new events or verify integrity.

**Mitigations**:
- **Formalized Contract Design and Review**:
  - Clear specification of data structures and invariants (e.g., monotonic event sequence numbers per evidence ID).
  - Peer review and security assessment of the design and implementation.
- **Controlled Upgrade Mechanisms**:
  - If upgradability is required, implement it with strict governance (e.g., multi‑sig for admin actions).
- **Use of Test Networks and Tools**:
  - Thorough testing on Ganache and other test networks before main deployment.
  - Use static analysis and fuzzing tools where appropriate.

---

### 8. Denial‑of‑Service (DoS)

**Description**: Attackers flood the API, blockchain node, or storage backends with requests to degrade service.

**Impact**:
- Delayed evidence registration and custody updates.
- Reduced availability for investigators and auditors.

**Mitigations**:
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**:
  - Enforce per‑user and per‑IP limits on API endpoints.
- **Autoscaling and Resource Isolation**:
  - Use container‑based scaling strategies for backend services where appropriate.
- **Circuit Breakers and Backoff Strategies**:
  - Gracefully handle blockchain or storage back‑pressure.

---

## Summary

By combining off‑chain encrypted storage for large evidence files with on‑chain immutable hashes and custody records, the system is designed to make tampering and unauthorized modifications **detectable and attributable**, while enforcing strong access control and privacy safeguards. This threat model should be revisited regularly as the system evolves and as new threats, regulatory requirements, and deployment contexts emerge.
